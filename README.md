This is a single page React app. The app is a simple memory card game, where the player click on cards and try to match all the cards. The size of the board can be updated based on user input.

Play the game [here](https://yareally10.github.io/memory-card-game/)!

The base file is taken from the React tutorial [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/master/static/html/single-file-example.html).

*Note:* My goal is to make this very light weight and can run as is (no need to build). Hence all the code (components) are bunched up together, instead of separated into their own files. All you need is to download index.html and it will work. Of course you'll also need the stylesheet to make the cards display correctly. I used a separate js file (from index.html) so it's easy to edit. If you update the js code, simply copy its entirety, and paste them in the "text/babel" script tag (after "add js code here").
